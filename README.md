# ws3.5_edison
Intel Edison Arduino Breakout Kit compatible library for Waveshare 3.5'' 320x240 LCD shield

I created library to make this thing work with Intel Edison. 

Requirements:
> Modified SPI.h from my "spi_16_edison" respository

Installation:
> Same as all other Arduino libraries

Warnings:
> Other display libraries may interfere with that one. If that happens try to use it with clean Arduino software.
